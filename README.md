# Slate With Pages
Hey, this is a repo containing an example of how to implement pagination such as seen on MS Word to you Slate React App.


## How to use
Inside the '/demo' folder you'll find a React app example with the paginated editor. To try it, open the folder, run `npm install` to install all dependencies and then `npm start`. 

The isolated package can be found under '/package'. More explanation on how it works can be seen there.

You can try the example and get a notion for how to implement it by yourself.
